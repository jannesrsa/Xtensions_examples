# SharePoint
Dynamically generate an operation's parameters using the x-ntx-dynamic-schema Specification Extension, so that you can use the same action to add items to any SharePoint list.

This example uses OAuth2 authentication.

_Note: Nintex Workflow Cloud provides actions for SharePoint online out-of-the-box; this example is provided only for demonstrative purposes._
